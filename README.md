# Mechanical-design-on-Onshape
This repository showcases 3D CAD designs created using Onshape, including a hexagonal screw and a mechanical pencil. The project demonstrates the use of tools such as revolve, extrude, sweep, and loft, highlighting practical applications and design techniques inspired by everyday objects.

## Overview
This repository contains the design of two 3D objects created using CAD tools as part of a project. The designs were created in Onshape and involved the use of at least three tools for each object.

## Task 1: Hexagonal Screw

### Description
This design represents a **hexagonal screw**, a commonly used fastener in various applications such as furniture assembly and machinery. The design consists of a threaded cylindrical body and a hexagonal head for tightening.

### Tools Used
1. **Revolve**: Used to create the cylindrical threaded body of the screw.
2. **Extrude Add**: Added the hexagonal head to the screw.
3. **Fillet**: Smoothed the edges of the hexagonal head for a refined finish.

### Utility
The screw can be used in practical applications for fastening components together securely. It is a common item in both mechanical and electronic assemblies.

## Task 2: Mechanical Pencil (Sharpened Stake)

### Description
The second design is inspired by a **mechanical pencil**. The design features an elongated cylindrical body with a sharp tip. It mimics the structure of a writing tool or a stake that can be used for various purposes.

### Tools Used
1. **Sweep**: Used to create the long cylindrical body.
2. **Loft**: Created the tapered, sharp tip.
3. **Shell**: Applied to hollow out parts of the design, reducing weight and material usage.

### Measuring Tools Used
- **Ruler**: For measuring the length of the pencil.
- **Caliper**: To measure the diameter of the body and tip for accurate dimensions.
